      <p class="w3-text-grey">WaterSmart’s service reflects the twelfth sustainable goal of the UN by raising awareness about traditional habits regarding water usage in people’s homes. Since Auckland is currently experiencing a drought, our aim is to help educate Aucklanders about more responsible water consumption practices. 
        Our application will offer products which help Aucklanders preserve water at home. Our service will directly contribute to the targets set by the UN. 
        One being to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, recycling and reuse. 
        Additionally, WaterSmart wants to ensure that Aucklanders have relevant information for sustainable development.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">WaterSmart’s application is going to offer products which will allow Aucklanders to directly tackle water wastage by starting in their own homes. Educating people on why they should purchase our products is the application's purpose and is why people will consider our value proposition. 
        Our products will help them save water using data that is recorded each month and available on our site via each user's account. This will differentiate our products from competitors by offering more specific information about our users. 
        This also provides easy access for the user to view their water usage from anywhere using our online login system which can also help interact more customers into buying our product. 
        Being an E-Commerce application, our products and services are offered over the internet. By using the internet as a medium, we are able to keep prices low as we do not require a retail store to hold transactions and such to take place. 
        The added benefit of being able to achieve exposure through the use of web technologies and search engine optimisation also gives us a competitive edge. With easier exposure, there is no huge need to advertise, which again allows us to keep costs at a minimum. Our website will be accessible, without additional fees, to anyone with an internet connection.</p>

      <h2><u>Our Service</u></h2>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Our service has been designed to educate and inform Aucklanders about environmentally sustainable water consumption practices. 
        WaterSmart aims to attract those that are currently uninformed about responsible water-use practices, 
        and those whose actions already align with our vision, to offer them with methods and products that will allow them to contribute 
        to the cause with minimal effort through use of water-saving tools and hopefully water-saving habits as well.</p>

        <h2><u>Our Target Audience</u></h2>
          Our target audience will be those with the ability to purchase and install our products for their homes, 
          which would commonly consist of parents or young adults, as they are more likely to understand the information 
          provided on the page and purchase the products offered through WaterSmart. 
          The target age range would be about 16 to 50. Little to no prior knowledge on the topic would be necessary, as the facts and figures should present themselves in the simplest manner possible. 
          The level of education required will be quite low. Medium-low to high levels of education would be more than sufficient to ensure that they are capable of understanding the information regarding water consumption, 
          and that they are able to use the instructions given on WaterSmart’s website to be guided through the installation process step by step. While our service can be targeted at just about every occupation, 
          it would further benefit from reaching those who can regularly affect more than just their own homes. Occupations such as plumbers or handymen are often employed to repair and renovate water-related systems in multiple different households. 
          As these occupations potentially have the ability to start using and promoting the services and products offered by WaterSmart, they may be some of our most ideal target occupations. We could also target businesses that readily provide public facilities that use water, 
          such as gyms and swimming pools that have showering facilities available.

          <h2><u>Why Our Product?</u></h2>
            Many people are more environmentally conscious these days as we are experiencing climate change and extreme weather all around the world. Specifically in Auckland, we are experiencing droughts due to less rainfall than normal. 
            According to Watercare Services, the total volume of water in the dams dropped below 50% in April, for the first time in more than 25 years. 
            The current situation motivates the public to preserve water in real life. WaterSmart hopes to capitalize on these motivations to influence people’s decisions regarding water use. 
            The main goal that we want to achieve with our application is to provide both products and services to help Aucklanders preserve water at home.
            We started identifying the goals from the smallest part of the problem. We are aware of the importance of saving water and anyone can preserve water by changing traditional water use practices. 
            The problem is people do not know what to change. WaterSmart will provide educational services including quick steps to preserve water in daily life and informing what bad water-consuming practices are. 
            We will also provide a range of products that can replace old and traditional water-consuming appliances. The products should be reusable and recyclable to meet our vision from the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
